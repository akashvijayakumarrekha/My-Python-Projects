# My Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of both ongoing and finished projects, showcasing my exploration and development in various domains. Feel free to explore the diverse range of projects, each designed to demonstrate different aspects of my coding and problem-solving skills.

## Ongoing Projects
### 1. Blogsite using Flask

#### Overview
This project focuses on developing a dynamic and user-friendly blog site using Flask, a Python web framework. The blog site is designed to allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as engage in discussions through comments. The use of Flask provides a lightweight and modular structure, making it easy to extend and customize.

#### Features
- User authentication: Secure user accounts with the ability to register, log in, and log out.
- Blog post management: Create, edit, and delete blog posts with an intuitive and responsive interface.
- Comment system: Engage with the community through comments on blog posts.

#### Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `python app.py`
3. Access the site at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

### 2. Learning Pandas

#### Overview
This project revolves around learning and applying the Pandas library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas provides powerful data structures and tools for working with structured data, making it an essential skill for data scientists and analysts.

#### Learning Objectives
- Data manipulation: Learn to filter, clean, and transform datasets.
- Data analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis and gain insights from data.
- Data visualization: Use Pandas in conjunction with visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

#### Resources
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- Online tutorials and exercises for hands-on learning.

### 3. AI Weather Dress Advisor

#### Overview
This project aims to develop an AI system that checks the weather and suggests suitable dress combinations based on the user's wardrobe. The AI considers the weather conditions and matches them with the available clothing items to provide personalized and weather-appropriate outfit suggestions.

#### Features
- Weather integration: Retrieve current weather conditions using a weather API (e.g., AccuWeather).
- Wardrobe management: User-friendly interface to manage and categorize clothing items.
- Dress recommendation: AI-driven suggestions based on weather, ensuring comfort and style.

#### Dependencies
- Python libraries: requests, pandas, scikit-learn
- Weather API: [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/apis)
