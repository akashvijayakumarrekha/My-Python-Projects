# Python Slot Machine Simulation

Welcome to the Python Slot Machine Simulation project! This project is designed to help you get familiar with fundamental programming concepts in Python by creating a simple slot machine game. Through this project, you'll have the opportunity to practice working with loops, conditions, dictionaries, and lists while building a functional and interactive program.

## Learning Goals

This project aims to provide you with hands-on experience in:

- Using loops to create a repetitive gameplay mechanism.
- Implementing conditional statements to handle different scenarios, such as valid inputs and winning conditions.
- Working with dictionaries to manage symbols and their respective counts and values in the slot machine.
- Utilizing lists to generate random results and display the slot machine grid.

## Features and Gameplay

In this slot machine simulation, you'll be able to:

- Deposit a starting amount to begin playing.
- Choose the number of lines to bet on, up to a maximum of 3.
- Set your bet amount for each line, with a range of €1 to €100.
- Spin the slot machine and witness the outcomes based on random symbol combinations.
- Calculate and display winnings based on winning lines and symbol values.
- Play multiple rounds and see how your balance changes over time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory: cd path/to/your/directory

3. Run the Python script: python main.py


4. Follow the prompts to make deposits, set bets, and spin the slot machine.
